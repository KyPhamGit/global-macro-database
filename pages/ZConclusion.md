title: Conclusion

Whilst analysing Polands GDP Growth, it has climbed Rapidly over the last 20 years.

The main contributing factor to the rapid growth definitely comes from their increase in export and imports. Showing significant productivity from trade.

Government debts, expense and investments are definitely scaled to their economy - meaning no significant differences to other economies. 
That being said, their debt is really low which can be crucial to see long term growth.

However, when analysing GDP per capita - in the recent years it has shown a rapid incline which signifys better quality of life. Which makes a lot of sense why house prices have gone up as more people have money to purchase property. 

Every other metric such as inflation, unemployment rate have been similar to other economies, thus no relationship can be drawn to their growth in this regard.

One thing that I found pretty consistent across Polands metrics is that during financial crisis such as 2008 and 2019, they were uneffected by such events comparing to countries like UK and GER.
